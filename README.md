# Image to Ambient Audio

This project is a simple, curiosity-driven experiment to generate ambient audio from an image. It includes a basic Python script (`image2sound.py`) that analyzes an image and creates a soundscape that reflects the image's content.

## How It Works

The script uses a multi-step process to generate audio from an image:

1.  **Image Captioning**: A model like BLIP is used to describe the contents of the photo in text (e.g., "a beautiful beach with waves crashing on the shore").
2.  **Prompt Engineering**: A descriptive audio prompt is constructed from the generated caption, focusing on ambient sounds.
3.  **Audio Generation**: An audio generation model (like Stable Audio) synthesizes a stereo WAV file based on the text prompt.

## Use Cases

This technology can be applied in various creative and practical ways:

*   **Meditation & Relaxation Apps**: Automatically generate calming soundscapes from serene images like forests, beaches, or mountains to aid in meditation and sleep.
*   **AR/VR & Gaming**: Enhance immersive experiences by dynamically creating ambient audio that matches the visual environment of a game or virtual world.
*   **Content Creation**: Quickly generate background audio for videos, podcasts, or presentations based on a theme or image.
*   **Prototyping**: A valuable tool for quickly prototyping sound design for films, games, and interactive installations.

## Examples

Here are a couple of examples generated by the script:

### Beach Scene

**Video (Image + Audio):**

![Beach Example](examples/beach.mp4)

*(Note: The generation of this audio clip peaked at 9217MB of VRAM.)*

### Office Environment

**Video (Image + Audio):**
